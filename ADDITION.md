#Addition
##Estimation
I estimate that it will take me about two hours to complete this implementation. I will have to add classes for each of the commands and then probably add at least two classes that actually do the calculation of handling the boundary. Then I will definitley have to modify the move method in the turtle class.

##Review
I was right. It took me about two hours to complete the implementation but I ended up modifying more classes than I originally thought. I actually ended up modifying nine classes to fix small methods. I did not get it completely right on the first try and had to play around with the math a bit to get it to work. The good thing was though that in terms of our code it was very obvious what I needed to change to get the implementation working.

##Analysis
Gnerally, I think that our design was extendable to this feature. Although figuring out how to do boundary correction on the was a little challenging, actually implementing the new commands was very easy. It could have been even easier had we not passed the turtle into the grid as part of the constructor (I had to change that to make things work).
